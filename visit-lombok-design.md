# Visit Lombok ID - Futuristic Tourism Website Design

## 1. Design Philosophy

### Overall Visual Direction

A futuristic and immersive digital experience that captures the breathtaking beauty of Lombok through a modern, high-tech lens. The aesthetic blends the clean, atmospheric sci-fi visuals of films like 'Arrival' and 'Blade Runner 2049' with the interactive elegance of advanced UI design. The core concept is 'Digital Horizon,' using flowing lines, subtle glows, and layered depth to evoke the island's natural landscapes—ocean, sky, and mountains—reimagined in a digital realm.

### Content Density

Medium density. The design prioritizes visual storytelling and immersive user experience. Each page features 1-3 key interactive elements, supported by large-scale imagery and animations. Generous spacing and a strong visual hierarchy guide the user through the content, creating a focused and engaging journey of discovery.

## 4. Image Style

Imagery should be cinematic and atmospheric. Favor high-resolution, wide-angle shots of Lombok's landscapes (beaches, mountains, waterfalls) with dramatic lighting, such as sunrise, sunset, or blue hour. Enhance photos with a subtle, cool-toned color grade to match the futuristic aesthetic. For UI elements, use abstract, flowing gradients that mimic natural phenomena like auroras or ocean waves.
