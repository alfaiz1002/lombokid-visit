# Website Personal Portfolio Design

## 1. Design Philosophy

### Overall Visual Direction

A clean, modern, and approachable personal website design that feels both professional and personable. The aesthetic is inspired by the minimalist yet characterful layouts of Kinfolk magazine, combined with the functional clarity of designers like Dieter Rams. The core idea is to create a digital space that feels organized and intentional, allowing the content to breathe and be easily understood.

### Content Density

Medium density. The design prioritizes clarity and visual impact. Each page presents 1-3 key pieces of information, supported by generous white space and a strong visual hierarchy. This approach is ideal for a personal website or portfolio where storytelling and making a memorable impression are key.

## 2. Color System

**Primary Colors**

- Background color: #F8F7F4 (warm off-white, creates a soft, welcoming atmosphere)
- Primary color: #2C3E50 (deep navy blue, conveys professionalism and trust)
- Secondary color: #7F8C8D (muted gray, provides subtle contrast and hierarchy)
- Accent color: #E7A46F (warm terracotta, adds personality and warmth)

**Text Colors**

- Dark text (for light backgrounds): #2C3E50 (deep navy for excellent readability)
- Light text (for dark backgrounds): #F8F7F4 (soft off-white for comfortable reading on dark surfaces)

## 3. Font Design

**Heading Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Oranienbaum (A high-contrast serif with elegant, classic lines, perfect for making a sophisticated statement in headlines)
  - Unna (An elegant serif with distinct vertical rhythm, lending a refined and literary feel to titles)

**Body Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Quattrocento Sans (A warm, humanist sans-serif that is highly readable and clear, ideal for body text and descriptions)
  - Hedvig Letters Sans (A characterful sans-serif with a personal touch, great for adding a bit of personality to descriptions)

## 4. Image Style

Imagery should be clean, bright, and intentional. Favor high-quality photography with natural light and a shallow depth of field. For a personal website, this includes professional but approachable portraits. For projects or portfolio items, use clean, uncluttered mockups or screenshots. Avoid generic stock photos.
